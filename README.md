# Wine_data
1. **Supervised Learning**: The dataset has labeled data, meaning that each sample (wine) has an associated target (quality), and the goal is to learn a mapping from features (like chemical properties, acidity, etc.) to the quality label.
   
2. **Multi-Class Classification**: Since the quality values range from 1 to 10, it is a classification problem with 10 possible output classes.
- **Feature Engineering**: You'd typically start by analyzing the features in the dataset (like acidity, alcohol content, pH, etc.) to identify which ones are most predictive of wine quality.

Key Points:
Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data.
Multi-Class Classification: The target variable "quality" has categoriesed: 1 to 10.
Categorical: The target variable is categorical, not continuous, so itâ€™s treated as a classification problem
